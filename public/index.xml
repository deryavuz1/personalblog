      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;oscp-preparation-revisited-in-2025&#34;&gt;OSCP Preparation Revisited in 2025&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back at a stressful year&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to write this because the OSCP was genuinely one of the hardest things I’ve done in my career so far, especially considering where I started - as I had comparably less knowledge than my peers when I began working as a security engineer. When I had obtained the OSCP, I had been in the field for a year and a half, but I learned everything on the job, through real client work, mistakes, panic, and figuring things out as I went.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the purposes of training our team for the Collegiate Penetration Team Competition (CPTC) for the 2025-2026 season, as team captain, I was facing the challenge of providing an accurate laboratory range environment that the team could potentially face during the competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, my awesome friends ran to my help and all of us together began the planning and building process of out CPTC mock competition range - our goal was to accurately convey a potential modern customer environment with a variation of Windows and Linux servers and other applications.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;About Me&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a security engineer and software developer with experience across offensive security, cloud infrastructure, and platform engineering. My work bridges deep technical execution with leadership in high-stakes cybersecurity competitions, consistently focusing on problem-solving, clarity under pressure, and building resilient systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professional Experience
Software Engineering Intern — Confluent&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;June 2025 – August 2025
At Confluent, I worked with the Cloud Infrastructure &amp;amp; Platform – Events team to build a Terraform provider in Go that integrates with an internal resource-management API. I gained hands-on experience with Kubernetes, Terraform, Golang development, and Semaphore CI/CD pipelines while designing and implementing robust CRUD operations for infrastructure automation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
